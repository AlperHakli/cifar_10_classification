<h1>CIFAR-10</h1>



📊 I built a complete image classification pipeline on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</br>
🔍 Started with data exploration and class distribution visualization.</br>
🧹 Then applied preprocessing and trained a custom 6-block CNN with fully connected layers, achieving up to 85% validation accuracy between epochs 20–40.</br>
📈 Visualized softmax probability outputs and ROC curves to evaluate model confidence and performance.</br>
🔁 Later, I implemented transfer learning using ResNet50, EfficientNetB1, and MobileNetV2, adding 3 custom dense layers on top.</br>
📊 Compared the performance of each model to find the best architecture for the task.</br>

💡 It was a hands-on and insightful experience combining classical CNNs and state-of-the-art pre-trained models.
